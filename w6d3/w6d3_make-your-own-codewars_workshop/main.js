        Write a function that takes in a recipe as an object and returns a string with just the names of each ingredient from the recipe. Make sure the string has no spaces at the end.

        The recipe object will always have an ingredients property which will be an array.

        Write a function that takes in two arrays and returns an array.
        The returned array must contain everything from the first array but not include any elements found in the second array.
        The returned array should not be ordered differently from the first array.
        
        [1, "Five", 2, 8], [1,2,3,4,5,6] should return ["Five", 8]
        ["apples", "bananas", "grapes"], ["kiwi", "pears"] should return ["apples", "bananas", "grapes"]
        [1,2,3], [1,2,3] should return []

        You discover that the first few words of the message are "I am now...",
        so shifting each letter two letters up the alphabet should show what it is written.
        Go and decode the message before you get into trouble.
        All the letters are in lowercase.
