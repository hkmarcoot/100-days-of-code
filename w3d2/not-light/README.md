# Not Light Challenge

Your challenge is to create a whole webpage in just 15 minutes. Too easy you say? I hear you. Then the conditions are:

- you have to edit the [`index.html`](./index.html) file in the GitHub file editing interface
- you cannot use any external resources
- you cannot preview your work until the very end of the task

Good luck ðŸ˜ƒ
